organizers
==========

A discussion repository for organizers of Vancouver meetups. This organization is an attempt to embrace a more open approach to organizing meetups in Vancovuer and distribute the burden of leading and organizing such events.

### Benefits of this approach

- Free
- meetups get their own "mailing list" (github issues).
- all Vancouver Meetup attendees leave with a GitHub account and a community they can ask questions to
- meetups can get pinged using `@vancouver-meetups/<meetup>`
- since all meetup members are [open open source](https://github.com/rvagg/node-leveldown#contributing) style contributors it means everyone gets empowered to help moderate discussions and improve the meetup

## How to start a new Vancouver meetup

**First, open an issue on this repo asking to get added as an Owner**

Your issue should say something like this (not everything is required but it's nice to tell us a little about yourself so you don't come across as a total stranger):

> Hi, I would like to start a meetup in vancouver for <name of technology>. I am <@your twitter name> on twitter and work at/on <name of company or project>. I will be co-organizing this chapter with <names of other organizers>. I have been using <name of technology> for 6 months and would like to help others learn as well.

Once you are an owner follow these instructions to set up your Vancouver meetup:

### Step 1

Meetup organizer should create a repo for their chapter, e.g. https://github.com/vancouver-meetups/iojs

The chapter name should preferably be the name of the technology, where the workshops will
be held. Alternatively the area should be specific, but yet meaningful, e.g `ruby` instead of
`programming` or `technology`. If you are covering multiple topics, consider creating multiple repos.

Also the repo name should be short and all lowercase (since this will also be your chapter url, see step 4).

### Step 2

Meetup organizer should make a new Team on the vancouver-meetups org with the same name. The owner then has to go into the chapter org and specifically add the chapter team as a collaborator:

### Step 3

**Everyone** who ever attends a vancouver-meetups event by that meetup should added as a member of the meetup team by the Owner (so they can open/close issues and push to the meetup org but can't e.g. delete repos). People can obviously decline the invitation to get added.

A note on github orgs: Only Owners can add new team members. The original Owner can add other trustworthy people from the meetup to the Owners team so that they can also add vancouver-meetups attendees to your meetups's team. Please use good judgment when adding new Owners, as Owners also have the ability to delete other meetups's repositories. 

That's all the mandatory steps. Here are some optional steps:

### Step 4 (optional)

You can [use this .AI/.SVG template](https://github.com/nodeschool/nodeschool.github.io/tree/master/images/make-a-sticker) to design your own custom vancouver-meetup sticker/logo. There is also a [design helper](http://www.finnpauls.de/nodeschool-stickerify/) for the browser based on the design for sketching a simple sticker.
